# General Service

The **GENERAL** layer is where SkyWalking's language agents report. Any service instrumented by a SkyWalking native agent — Java, .NET (CLR), Go, Python, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and the Spring Boot / Spring Sleuth meter integrations — lands here, so it is the most-used layer and the reference dashboard every other layer's dashboard is modelled on.

In Horizon's sidebar this layer is named **General Service**. Its services are listed as **Services**, instances as **Instances** (each badged with the agent **language**), and endpoints as **API** — the endpoint-to-endpoint view is called **API dependency**. The GENERAL layer enables the full set of sub-tabs: Service, Instance, Endpoint, API dependency, Topology, Traces, Logs, and the profiling tabs (trace, eBPF, async, pprof).

This page is the **operator reference** for the bundled GENERAL dashboard: what you see on each scope and what each widget means.

> The widgets and metrics below are read from the bundled GENERAL template; if an operator has published a customized GENERAL template to OAP, the live dashboard reflects that copy instead. See [Layer Dashboard Templates](../customization/layer-templates.md) for how the bundled default, your local draft, and the OAP-published copy relate.

## Service list

Before opening a service, the layer landing page lists every GENERAL service with three sortable columns, sorted by traffic (**RPM**) by default:

- **RPM** — calls per minute (`service_cpm`).
- **Apdex** — user-satisfaction score on a 0 – 1 scale (`service_apdex/10000`).
- **Error Rate** — percent of failed calls (`100 - service_sla/100`).

## Service dashboard

The primary drill-down for one selected service.

- **Top 20 APIs** — the busiest endpoints under this service, with tabs to re-rank by **Traffic** (`endpoint_cpm`, rpm), **Slow** (`endpoint_resp_time`, ms), and **Successful Rate** (`endpoint_sla`, %, worst-first). Click a row to jump into that endpoint.
- **Traffic** — calls per minute for the service (`service_cpm`).
- **Error Rate** — percent of failed calls (`100 - service_sla/100`).
- **Apdex** — user-satisfaction score on a 0 – 1 scale (`service_apdex/10000`).
- **Response Time Percentile** — p50 / p75 / p90 / p95 / p99 latency, the tail of the response-time distribution (`service_percentile`).
- **Avg Response Time** — mean latency in ms (`service_resp_time`).
- **MQ Consume rate + latency** — message-queue consume count and latency on a dual axis: count on the left, latency on the right (`service_mq_consume_count`, `service_mq_consume_latency`).
- **Top 10 instances by load** — this service's instances ranked by traffic (`service_instance_cpm`, rpm).
- **Top 10 slowest instances** — instances ranked by average response time (`service_instance_resp_time`, ms).
- **Top 10 instances by success rate** — instances ranked worst-first by success rate (`service_instance_sla`, %).
- **Slow Database Statements** — the 20 slowest sampled database statements captured against this service (`top_n_service_database_statement`, ms). Each row carries the statement text and, when the sample has one, a jump-to-trace link. Shows `no data` when OAP captured no statements in the window.

The latency and error widgets ship with the **metric-to-trace drill** enabled: click a data point on **Avg Response Time** or **Response Time Percentile** to open the slowest traces at that moment, or on **Error Rate** or **Apdex** to open the error traces. The same drill rides the instance latency / success-rate widgets and the endpoint latency, percentile, success-rate, and MQ-latency widgets below. See [Dashboard Widgets → Metric-to-trace drill](../components/dashboard-widgets.md#metric-to-trace-drill-tracedrill).

## Instance dashboard

For one selected service instance. The first three widgets always render; the rest are **runtime-specific** and appear only when the instance actually reports those metrics — so a Java instance shows the JVM family, a Go instance the Golang family, and so on, without manual configuration.

**Always shown**

- **Service Instance Load** — calls per minute against the instance (`service_instance_cpm`).
- **Service Instance Latency** — average response time in ms (`service_instance_resp_time`).

- **JVM Memory** — heap and non-heap used / max in MB (`instance_jvm_memory_heap`, `instance_jvm_memory_heap_max`, `instance_jvm_memory_noheap`, `instance_jvm_memory_noheap_max`).
- **JVM Memory Detail** — per-pool used memory in MB: code cache, newgen, oldgen, survivor, permgen, metaspace, plus the newer JVM pools (zheap, compressed class space, and the segmented codeheaps). Pools a JVM doesn't expose stay at 0.

**Spring (Spring Boot Actuator / Spring Sleuth meters)**

- **Spring HTTP Request Count** and **Spring HTTP Request Duration** — `http.server.requests` count and latency.
- **Spring Instance CPU Usage** / **Spring OS CPU Usage** / **Spring OS System Load** — process CPU, OS CPU, and 1-minute load average.
- **Spring OS Process Files** — open vs max file descriptors.
- **Spring JVM GC Pause Duration**, **Spring JVM Memory** (used / max), **Spring JVM Threads** (live / daemon / peak), **Spring JVM Classes** (loaded / unloaded).
- **Spring Database Connection Pool** (HikariCP / datasource), **Spring Thread Pool**, **Spring JDBC Connections** (active / idle / max), **Spring Tomcat Sessions** (active / max / rejected).

**Python (PVM instances)**

- **Python CPU Utilization** and **Python Memory Utilization** — host vs process.
- **Python Thread Count**, **Python GC Count** (gen 0 / 1 / 2), and **Python GC Time**.

**Ruby instances**

**Node.js instances**

- **Process CPU** — process CPU percentage (`meter_instance_nodejs_process_cpu`).
- **V8 Heap Used** / **V8 Heap Total** / **V8 Heap Limit** — the V8 heap in MB: currently used, currently allocated, and the maximum the heap may grow to (`meter_instance_nodejs_heap_used` / `_heap_total` / `_heap_limit`).

- **MQ Avg Consuming Latency** — consume latency in ms, shown only for endpoints that serve message-queue traffic (`endpoint_mq_consume_latency`).

## Topology and maps

The GENERAL layer ships a full set of maps.

**Topology (service map)** — every service node is decorated with **RPM** (`service_cpm`), an **SLA** health ring (`service_sla/100`, colored green / amber / red — higher is better, so the ring turns red as success rate drops), and **Latency** (`service_resp_time`). Each call edge carries server-side and client-side **RPM**, **Avg response time**, **p95**, and **SLA** (`service_relation_server_*` and `service_relation_client_*`), shown aligned in the edge panel.

**Instance map** — from a call between two services on the service map, drill into the instance-to-instance calls between them. The same node / edge metric set is evaluated at instance scope (`service_instance_*` and `service_instance_relation_server/client_*`).

**API dependency (endpoint map)** — the endpoint-to-endpoint dependency view. Each endpoint node shows **RPM** (`endpoint_cpm`), an **SLA** ring (`endpoint_sla/100`), and **Latency** (`endpoint_resp_time`); each edge shows **RPM**, **Avg response time**, **p95**, and **SLA** (`endpoint_relation_*`). Endpoint relations are server-side only.

For how these maps are read and navigated, see the [3D Infrastructure Map](../operate/infra-3d-map.md) for the cross-layer view, and the topology section of [Layer Dashboard Templates](../customization/layer-templates.md) for how the node and edge metrics are configured.

## Requirements

The GENERAL dashboard is a pure consumer of what OAP reports — it invents no data, and a widget with no backing data simply reads `no data`. To populate it, OAP needs:

- **Service / instance / endpoint metrics** — the `service_*`, `service_instance_*`, and `endpoint_*` families (traffic, response time, SLA, apdex, percentiles), produced by OAP from agent-reported traces or meters.
- **Relation metrics** — `service_relation_*`, `service_instance_relation_*`, and `endpoint_relation_*` for the service map, instance map, and API-dependency views.
- **Runtime metrics**, for the runtime-specific instance widgets to appear: JVM (`instance_jvm_*`), CLR (`instance_clr_*`), the Spring meter family (`meter_*`), and the Golang / Python / Ruby / Node.js / PHP agent meter families. An instance only shows the families its agent emits.
- **Sampled records** — `top_n_service_database_statement` for the Slow Database Statements list, captured by OAP when slow-statement sampling is enabled.

Each metric is queried at its own OAP scope; OAP does not roll a metric up across scopes, so an instance- or endpoint-scope metric is empty until that level of data is reported. When a whole family is missing (for example a non-JVM runtime), its widgets are hidden rather than shown empty.
