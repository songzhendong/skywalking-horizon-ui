/**
 * OAP UI-template sync orchestrator.
 *
 * Two entry points:
 *   - `bootSeed()` runs ONCE at BFF startup. It lists OAP templates, seeds
 *     any bundled template that's missing on OAP (this is the only path
 *     that writes-on-absence), then returns the merged status.
 *   - `getSyncStatus()` runs on-demand (every `/api/configs/bundle` hit).
 *     30-second single-flight cache; pure read against OAP. Never writes,
 *     even when remote is missing — operator action is required.
 *
 * When the admin port is unreachable:
 *   - `bootSeed()` logs a warning and returns `unreachable: true` so the
 *     server still finishes boot.
 *   - `getSyncStatus()` returns `unreachable: true` so the UI shows the
 *     read-only banner; render falls back to bundled.
 *
 * Equality is byte-exact on the canonicalized envelope (see `names.ts`).
 * OAP stores the configuration string verbatim, so a round-trip without
 * operator edit produces the same string.
